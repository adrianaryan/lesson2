    <h1>Problems Solved by Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>
      With more and more people accessing the web from multiple devices,
      it is now crucial to use Responsive Web Design (RWD) when you create
      a website because it allows their sites to be automatically displayed
      on any system, no matter what the screen size is. My friend who is
      smartphone user visited my portfolio website complained that my website
      is difficult to navigate because they have to pinch and zoom to do anything.
      This is maybe because my website is optimized for only desktop.
      Although, I could create a mobile friendly website for the smartphone users,
      using RWD is the best way to solve the multi-device optimization problem for my website.
      Responsive website is flexible on all platforms (desktop, smartphone, tablet, etc.)
      and it will optimize the screen size and viewing orientation (landscape or portrait)
      of the mobile version of your site, making your work much easier.
      So, if you have any issues with your lack of mobile optimization,
      then RWD is the best solution that will optimize your website for all devices.
